Ideas for the LED driver v2
===========================

- Analog dimming input
- Analog dimming reference voltage (maximum dimming), can be connected to
  analog dimming input with a jumper.
- Defaults for PWM dimming (pullup, pulldown) and other inputs
  (where applicable)
- Voltage output 5 V instead of 24 V
- Reduce audible noise (somehow)
- Use smaller MOSFETs
- Use better Schottky-diode
- Use higher rated inductor (to reduce heat)
- Maybe use different connector
- Maybe use optocouplers for signals
- Maybe put microcontroller on board (ATtiny) for on, off, dim, dim curve only

Pinout of the current LED driver and suggested changes
------------------------------------------------------
1 FLT (fault)
2 RT/SYNC (clock)
3 UVEN (enable, default )
4 PWMDIM (digital dimming)  -> new: pullup + pulldown (so no jumper is needed)
5 GND
6 VIN (24 V)                -> new: 5 V through LDO
(7)                         -> new: Analog dim reference
(8)                         -> new: Analog dim input
